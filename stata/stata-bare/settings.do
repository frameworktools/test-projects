* settings.do: paths for stata-bare
*
* fw wrote this file from the project spec. Every do-file refers to folders
* through these globals, so the project runs on any machine without edits.
* Stata cannot read the project's YAML settings, so the paths live here.
*
* Run Stata from the project folder: cd to it first, or open master.do from
* there. The root is set from the current folder every time, because globals
* from another project in the same Stata session would otherwise linger.

global root `"`c(pwd)'"'
capture confirm file `"$root/settings.do"'
if _rc {
    display as error `"settings.do: $root is not the project folder. In Stata, cd to the folder that holds settings.do and master.do, then run the do-file again."'
    exit 601
}
